# Code-Refactor

The reason for refactoring the code on the existing webpage was due to creating the page more accessible to individuals with disabilities. I created this code based on my belief that all humans should be recipients of technology in an equal manner. The journey for completing this job was not easy, I pushed myself & learned many things along the way. Throughout the code you will see the input of Semantic HTML5 code such as 'header', 'main', 'aside', 'nav', 'section', and 'footer'. These elements don't just add convenience to your code but also add the ability for those with disabilities to use screen readers, magnifiers, and much more to access your website. I also simplified the CSS document included. There were many repetitive codes with the only difference being a different class name, I went ahead and added a common name to those classes to minimize the use of total code. 

 I would like to thank Max van der Schee for the development of Web Accessibility, an application in the Virtual Studio Code program. The addon assisted me in finding which lines needed to be altered and allowed for me to find a starting point for my venture of completing this project.
